# Rob-O-Tronic

Rob-O-Tronic is an isometric puzzle game written in C++ using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) graphics library. It was developed several years ago as part of the dissertation for my degree. I've uploaded the source here in hopes that it might be useful to anyone building their own isometric engine.
